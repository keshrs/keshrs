## Howdy, I’m Rikesh - also known, in some places, as: @keshrs, Kesh, Rik.

**If we haven't met before, here's my canned GitHub intro**:

I am a software engineer with a lean towards all things user-facing; I fancy design, psychology, data visualization, and writing. In the past, projects I've enjoyed have included XR research & development (building holograms for live performances, city maps, and more!), UX design & frontend implementations for 3D experiences, introductory graphics programming, and improving application accessibility. What do these have in common? I couldn't tell you exactly, but they've all made me feel like I'm visibly contributing to the _sometimes nebulous_ idea of "technology improving humanity", but, like, actually.

Lately, I’ve been working with React-based Lua (Luau + Roact) to build app frontend and client systems at Roblox. Often, this also involves peeking into C++ and tweaking systems + game engine code. I've also taken some interest in playing with audio plugins for DAWs, data visualization, and XR scipting + UX. However, as a young engineer in this complex world of "Tech", I'm often learning my lessons from the challenges put on my plate and growing from there.


I’m looking to collaborate on anything you can convince me will improve how people & communities use technology. Just reach out :)

If you want to reach me, see: email on my profile, or if you're feeling creative, requesting me for review!
