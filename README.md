- 👋 Hi, I’m @keshrs -- known in some circles as Rikesh, Kesh, or get this... Rik
- 👀 I’m interested in XR development, frontend, graphics, user-facing technologies, and MOST IMPORTANTLY contributing to ethical technology + culture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend React ecosystem, XR scipting + UX, and general mobile & app systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you can convince me will improve how people & communities use technology. Just reach out :)
- 📫 How to reach me: email on my profile, or if you're feeling creative, requesting me for review!

Main focus right now, as far as coding/tech goes, is improving my skills as a software engineer and growing my career. That being said, in the near future I hope to learn, create and contribute to projects involving audio processing, music software, visualization, UX implementation, and general tools for building community (whether a D&D player assistant or municipal resource management)!
